# 3-axis-gimbal
The gimbal is a hardware open-source platform, while the algorithm is closed-source.<br>
The result is shown below.<br>

I developed an algorithm based on this platform, and a pyqt gui to tune the PID value online.

The motor is a strong nonlinear system, maybe some advanced control algorithms should be used to improve the performance.<br>
